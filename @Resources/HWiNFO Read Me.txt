You will need update the HWiNFO IDs included in this skin to match the IDs for your system.  To do this:
1 - ensure HWiNFO is running, with sensors and shared memory active
2 - run the included "HWiNFOSharedMemoryViewer.exe" file - you can also launch this by clicking the HWiNFO icon in the rainmeter skin
3 - find the sensor reading you need (CPU Usage for example) and make note of the sensor id, sensor instance and entry id
4 - edit the HWiNFO.inc file in the @Resources folder to replace the provided IDs with the IDs for your system
5 - refresh the HWiNFO skin
